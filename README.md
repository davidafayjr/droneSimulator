# droneSimulator
This  code transmits simulated location information to a firebase realtime database using a HUZZAH ESP8266.  
## Dependancies
You will need to install the ESP8266 library from here https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino.
You will also need to install a customized firebase-arduino library zip file in which I will include in this repository.  Instrucions can be found here https://github.com/firebase/firebase-arduino/blob/master/examples/FirebaseDemo_ESP8266/README.md.
